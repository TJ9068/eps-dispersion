EPS Dispersion Strategy
A Long–Short Equity Signal Based on Realized Fundamental Uncertainty

This repository implements a quantitative trading strategy that exploits persistent earnings volatility as a priced source of risk or mispricing. The strategy uses a five-year trailing dispersion in EPS (Earnings Per Share) as a proxy for fundamental uncertainty, constructing a long–short portfolio that consistently outperforms the market on both absolute and risk-adjusted bases.

📘 Background & Motivation
Traditional literature (e.g., Diether, Malloy & Scherbina, 2002) focuses on analyst forecast dispersion as a measure of uncertainty, often associated with overvaluation. In contrast, this strategy uses realized EPS dispersion — a backward-looking, accounting-based signal — to identify firms that are hard to value due to volatile fundamentals.

Inspired by findings from Zhang (2006), Pastor & Veronesi (2003, 2009), and Bali, Cakici & Whitelaw (2014), this project shows that realized uncertainty may reflect real economic risk, not just disagreement — and thus commands a premium.

🔍 Strategy Overview
Signal Construction:
EPS Calculation: Annual EPS = Net Income (NIQ) / Shares Outstanding (CSHOQ), from Compustat

Dispersion Metric: 5-year trailing coefficient of variation (CV) of annual EPS

Filters:

Minimum 5 valid EPS observations

Exclude firms with near-zero mean EPS

Price filter ≥ $5 to reduce microcap noise

Portfolio Formation:
Universe: U.S. equities from CRSP/Compustat, 1966–2024

Monthly Sorting: Stocks sorted into quintiles based on 5-year EPS dispersion

Long–Short Portfolio: Long Q5 (high dispersion), Short Q1 (low dispersion)

Rebalancing: Monthly

Volatility Targeting: 20% annualized volatility on each leg

Transaction Costs: 20 bps/month subtracted from gross returns

📊 Key Results (2019–2024 Backtest)
Metric	Value
Net Compounded Annual Return	23.80%
Sharpe Ratio (net)	1.13
FF3 Alpha (net)	16.21% (t = 2.00)
Skewness	0.72
Kurtosis	0.26
Sector Tilt (Long)	Biotech, Public Admin, Holding Co.
Sector Tilt (Short)	Banks, Utilities, Insurance

📈 Alpha persists across size deciles and market conditions, with low correlation to standard risk factors.

🧠 Interpretation
Risk-Based View:
High dispersion reflects real risk: cash flow instability, macro sensitivity, operating leverage

Investors require compensation → priced risk premium

Behavioral View:
Complex firms are avoided due to ambiguity aversion or institutional frictions

Mispricing persists due to neglect → alpha from behavioral underreaction

🛠️ Implementation Details
Code Pipeline (EPS_Dispersion.ipynb):
Data Cleaning: Load Compustat quarterly NIQ & CSHOQ, fill with CRSP SHROUT

Signal Generation: Compute 5-year EPS dispersion for each firm-year

Portfolio Construction: Merge with CRSP returns, apply price filter, quintile sort

Performance Evaluation:

CAPM & FF3 regressions (with HAC robust t-stats)

Rolling Sharpe and Alpha plots

Skew/Kurtosis diagnostics

Robustness:

Volatility targeting & cost modeling

Out-of-sample validation (2019–2024)
